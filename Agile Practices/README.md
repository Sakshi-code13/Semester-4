## Introduction

Agile practices refer to a set of principles and methodologies that promote flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability in project management. Unlike traditional waterfall approaches, agile methodologies prioritize iterative development and frequent feedback loops. This allows teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver high-quality products efficiently.

Experiments:-
1. [Mapping Agile Development approach with Software Development](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Agile-Practices/Agile%20Practices/Experiment%201.docx)
The experiment aimed to bridge the gap between traditional software development methodologies and agile principles. It sought to identify the commonalities and differences between the two approaches and determine the feasibility of integrating agile practices into software development processes.

2. [Test Driven Development using Junit](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Agile-Practices/Agile%20Practices/Experiment%202.docx)
The experiment aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of TDD, a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code, in conjunction with JUnit for automated testing. The objective was to determine whether TDD, when combined with JUnit, could lead to improved code quality, increased developer productivity, and faster development cycles.

3. [Test Driven Development using Selenium](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Agile-Practices/Agile%20Practices/Experiment%203.docx) 
The experiment aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combining TDD principles with Selenium for automated testing. TDD is a software development practice that involves writing tests before writing the actual code, while Selenium is widely used for web application testing.

4. [Explain the software development scenario using Extreme Programming(XP)](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Agile-Practices/Agile%20Practices/Experiment%204.docx)
Extreme Programming (XP) is a specific agile methodology that focuses on producing higher-quality software and improving the quality of life for the development team. It emphasizes appropriate engineering practices for software development.

5. [Explain the Software development scenario using Scrum](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Agile-Practices/Agile%20Practices/Experiment%205.docx)
Scrum is a popular agile methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. It is designed to enable teams to deliver high-quality software products predictably and efficiently.
