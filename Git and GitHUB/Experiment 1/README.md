# Install Git and create the repository

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development for managing source code changes efficiently. It provides developers with the ability to track modifications, collaborate on projects, and maintain a complete history of revisions. With Git, developers can create local repositories on their machines, make changes to files, stage those changes, and commit them with meaningful messages.
