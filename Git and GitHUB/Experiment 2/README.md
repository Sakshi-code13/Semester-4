# Creating branches with GitHub

### About Branches
Branches in GitHub serve as parallel streams of development within a repository, allowing developers to work on distinct features or fixes without directly altering the main codebase. Commonly named master or main, the main branch represents the stable version of the project. Developers create branches for specific tasks, such as implementing new features or addressing bugs, and isolating changes to facilitate management and review. Pull requests are then used to merge these changes into the main branch after review. GitHub offers options for merging, including regular merges and squash merges, and allows repository owners to protect branches to ensure code quality. Once changes are merged or become obsolete, branches can be deleted, maintaining a clean repository. Overall, GitHub branches streamline collaboration, version control, and code organization in software development projects.

## Steps to create a branch on the GitHub

• Navigate to Repository: Go to the GitHub repository where you want to create a new branch.

• Click on the Branch Dropdown: On the repository's main page, locate the dropdown menu that displays the current branch (usually named main or master).

• Enter Branch Name: Type the desired name for your new branch into the text field. Make sure the branch name is descriptive and relevant to the changes you'll be making.

• Create the Branch: After typing the branch name, press Enter or click on the "Create branch" button next to the text field.

• Confirmation: GitHub will confirm that the branch has been created, and you'll be automatically switched to the newly created branch.

## Steps to create a branch on the Git

• Clone Repository: If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command.

• Navigate to Repository Directory: Use the cd command to navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.

• Create Branch: Run the following command to create a new branch: 'git checkout -b ' Replace with the desired name for your new branch.

• Push Branch to GitHub: If you want to push the new branch to GitHub, use the following command: 'git push origin '
This command pushes the newly created branch to GitHub, making it available for collaboration.
