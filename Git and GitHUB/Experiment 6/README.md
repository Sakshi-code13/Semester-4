# Creation of Forks on GitHub

## About Forking

Forking, within the realm of version control systems such as Git and platforms like GitHub, entails the creation of a personal copy of an existing repository hosted by another user. This process essentially duplicates the entirety of the project, encompassing its codebase, commit history, and branches, and places it within the context of your own GitHub account. The purpose of forking is to provide developers with the freedom to explore and experiment with modifications without impacting the original repository. It serves as a pivotal mechanism for collaboration, particularly in open-source projects. Developers can utilize forks to address bugs, introduce new features, or refine existing code, aiming to contribute these changes back to the parent project via pull requests. This decentralized approach to development fosters an environment conducive to community-driven contributions, promoting innovation and collective advancement within the software development landscape.

Steps to create a fork and make changes on git:

• Choose the profile of any person whose repository you want to fork on GitHub.

• Click on the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

• After forking, you'll have the option to provide a name for your forked repository and add a description if you want.

• Once the fork is created, you'll have access to all the contents of the repository's main branch. You can make changes to this branch and sync it with the original repository owner's repository if needed.

• Clone the forked repository onto your local machine using the command: git clone "URL/username/repo_name.git"

• Create a branch “Feature1”, to add the changes.

• Create a new file or edit an existing file on the branch.

• Enter the details or content into the file. You can also view the contents of the file.

• Add the created file to the staging area using the command: git add file_name.txt.

• Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message using the command: git commit -m "message you want to display"

• Push the changes to the remote repository (your fork) using the command: git push origin Feature1.

• After pushing, you can see the changes reflected on your forked repository on GitHub. You can also compare the changes and open a pull request, but keep in mind that you won't be able to merge it as only users with write access
