# Create and explore Pull request

## What is a Pull request?

A pull request is a fundamental aspect of collaborative software development, particularly within version control systems like Git. It represents a formalized process through which developers propose changes to a codebase. When a developer completes a new feature or fixes a bug, they create a pull request to merge their changes into the main codebase. The pull request includes details about the changes made, and the purpose of those changes, and often undergoes review by other team members for feedback, code quality, and adherence to project standards. Once approved, the changes are merged into the main branch, ensuring a controlled and organized workflow that facilitates collaboration and maintains code integrity.
There are 2 main workflows when dealing with pull requests:

• Pull Request from a forked repository

• Pull Request from a branch within a repository

## Pull Request from a forked repository

• Fork the repository.

• Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

• Create a new branch to work on your changes.

• Make changes to the codebase.

• Stage and commit your changes.

• Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

• Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

• Switch to the branch you just pushed.

• Click on "New pull request".

• Compare the changes and create the pull request.


## Pull Request from a branch within a repository

• Navigate to the repository on GitHub.

• Click on the "Branch" dropdown menu and select the branch you want to create the pull request from.

• Once on the desired branch, click on the "New pull request" button next to the branch name.

• Review the changes and the base branch for the pull request.

• Provide a title and description for the pull request.

• Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit the pull request.

## Pull on Git Bash

• Open Git Bash.

• Navigate to the local repository directory using the cd command.

• Create a new branch using the git checkout -b command followed by the branch name.

• Make changes to the codebase.

• Stage the changes using the git add command.

• Commit the changes using the git commit -m "commit message" command.

• Push the branch to the remote repository using the git push origin branch-name command.

• Visit the repository on GitHub.

• Switch to the newly pushed branch.

• Click on the "New pull request" button.

• Review the changes and select the base branch for the pull request.

• Provide a title and description for the pull request.

• Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit the pull request.
