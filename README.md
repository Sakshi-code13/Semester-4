[Desing and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) - 22CSH-282](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/tree/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms)

The design and analysis of algorithms involve various techniques and approaches. Algorithms can be classified based on their implementation method, design method, design approaches, and other classifications. This classification helps in organizing, understanding, and comparing different algorithms. It also helps in identifying the best algorithm for a specific problem and comparing their performance in terms of time and space complexity.

## Experiments:-
1. [Implementation of Binary Search using the Divide & Conquer Approach](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%201.docx)
Binary search is a search algorithm that follows the divide and conquer technique. It is based on the idea of ordered searching, where the algorithm divides a sorted list into two halves and performs the search based on the comparison of the key value with the mid-point value of the list. If the key value is lower than the mid-point value, the search continues on the left half; otherwise, it continues on the right half.

2. [Implementation of Quick Sort Algorithm using Divide & Conquer Approach](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%202.docx) 
Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer technique. It is based on the idea of partitioning a list into smaller sublists and then recursively sorting those sublists.

3. [Implementation of Strassen's Matrix multiplication](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%203.docx)
Strassen's algorithm is a divide-and-conquer method for multiplying matrices. It is based on the idea of splitting the matrices into smaller submatrices and performing multiplications on these submatrices to compute the final result.

4. [Find out the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree using Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm with the help of the Greedy Approach](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%204.pdf)
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy approach used to find the minimum cost-spanning tree in a connected weighted graph. The algorithm treats each node as an individual tree and connects them based on the edges with the lowest cost, without creating cycles in the resulting tree.

5. [Perform Job Sequencing with a deadline using the Greedy Approach using C/C++](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%205.pdf)
Job sequencing with the deadline is a problem where we have a set of jobs, each with a deadline and a profit associated with it. The goal is to find the maximum profit by scheduling the jobs within their deadlines. This problem can be solved using a greedy approach.

6. [Implement Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%206.pdf)
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It involves finding the shortest possible route that visits all the given cities and returns to the starting city.

7. [Perform Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem (MCM) using Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/Sakshi-code13/Semester-4/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms/Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms/Experiment%207.pdf)
The Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) problem involves finding the most efficient way to multiply a series of matrices. The goal is to minimize the total number of scalar multiplications required to compute the final product.
