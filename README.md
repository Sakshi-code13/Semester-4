Git and GitHub are integral tools in the software development process. Git's distributed version control system enables efficient collaboration, branching, and merging, while GitHub provides a web-based platform with additional features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools. Together, these tools empower developers to work seamlessly, manage projects effectively, and ensure the integrity of their codebase throughout the development lifecycle.
